Singly Linked List Implementation in Python
This repository contains a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Built as part of a summer internship assignment, this project demonstrates foundational data structure concepts and exception handling in Python.

ðŸš€ Features:
Node and LinkedList classes for clean OOP design

Add nodes to the end of the list

Print the linked list

Delete the nth node (1-based index)

Handles edge cases:

Deleting from an empty list

Index out of range errors
